Written By: Sherd White for CS6420 Assignment # 4

The goal is to perform canny and sobel edge detection.

REQUIRES
------------

OPENCV 3.x and a compatible C++ compiler.  


RUNNING THE PROGRAM
----------------

The program performs canny and sobel edge detection on an input image, output the edge images, and then copy the edge image over the original in red.

For example.
edgedetect file.jpg # results in output of the original, two edge images, and two final images of the original with edges superimposed in red.


DESIGN DECISIONS
----------------
These are simple implimentations of the built in Canny and Sobel functions in openCV for comparison.
